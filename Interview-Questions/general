1. Why you left your previous organization
"My previous organization provided a great foundation, but the environment became very static.
I am someone who thrives on solving new problems and implementing the latest cloud-native technologies.
I chose to move on so I could find a challenge that matches my growth—specifically a role where I can take full ownership of the DevOps lifecycle and produce the results that builds Organisational Revenue.

2.Why there is 4 months Gap ?
I took a short break from my career to focus on personal growth and upskilling.
During that time, I improved my techincal skills , worked on few personal projects and kept myself updated with industry needs.
Now i'm ready to apply that knowledge in a full-time role with fresh motivation.

Right now, my main focus is finding the right fit for my technical skills in cloud and DevSecOps ground. 
Based on responsibilities and market value, I’m looking for something in the range of 18–20 LPA
but I am open to discussing this further once I understand the full scope of the responsibilities and the total benefits package
========================================Technical Round===================================
I'm looking for a competitive offer that reflects the specialized skills 
I bring in Kubernetes automation and DevSecOps security standards.
I’m sure if I’m the right technical fit for the team,
we can come to an agreement on a number that works for both of us.
======================================= HR Interview ======================================
My current CTC is 12 LPA , and I am expecting 18-20 LPA
However, I am also looking at the 'Total Rewards'—including performance bonuses, stocks, and growth opportunities.
Is this within the budget you have allocated for this position?
