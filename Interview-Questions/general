1. Why you left your previous organization
"My previous organization provided a great foundation, but the environment became very static.
I am someone who thrives on solving new problems and implementing the latest cloud-native technologies.
I chose to move on so I could find a challenge that matches my growth—specifically a role where I can take full ownership of the DevOps lifecycle and produce the results that builds Organisational Revenue.

2.Why there is 4 months Gap ?
I took a short break from my career to focus on personal growth and upskilling.
During that time, I improved my techincal skills , worked on few personal projects and kept myself updated with industry needs.
Now i'm ready to apply that knowledge in a full-time role with fresh motivation.
