☸️ Kubernetes Core Concepts & Resource GuideProject Scope: vgdorder.onlineEnvironment: Production-Ready Configuration🏛️ Phase 1: Governance & Resource ControlFileResource NameKey Capabilities01.ns.ymlNamespaceIsolation: Creates a "virtual cluster" to keep projects separate.Security: Scope for RBAC permissions.Management: Prevent cross-project resource interference.02.rq.ymlResource QuotaHard Limits: Max CPU/RAM per namespace.Object Counting: Limits total Pods/Services.Stability: Prevents "Noisy Neighbor" syndrome.03.lr.ymlLimit RangeDefaulting: Assigns CPU/RAM if developer forgets.Constraints: Enforces Min/Max pod sizes.Granularity: Works at the container level.📦 Phase 2: Workloads & Scaling04.po.yml — PodSmallest Unit: The basic building block that runs your container.Ephemeral: Pods are temporary; they are designed to be replaced, not repaired.Shared Resources: Containers inside a Pod share the same Network (IP) and Storage.05.rc.yml — Replication ControllerLegacy Tool: The older version of the ReplicaSet.Desired State: Ensures exactly "X" number of Pods are running.Self-Healing: Automatically replaces crashed Pods.06.rs.yml — ReplicaSetModern Scaling: The successor to the RC with advanced "Label Selectors."Grouping: Uses complex logic to decide which Pods to manage.Deployment Component: Usually managed automatically by a Deployment.07.dep.yml — DeploymentManagement: The standard way to deploy vgdorder.online.Rolling Updates: Updates the application with zero downtime.Rollbacks: Instantly revert to a previous stable version if a bug is detected.🌐 Phase 3: Networking & Advanced Workloads08.svc.yml — ServiceStable IP: Provides a permanent entry point for pods that change IPs.Load Balancing: Balances traffic across all healthy Pod replicas.External Access: Using type: LoadBalancer creates a cloud-native ELB.09.hpa.yml — Horizontal Pod AutoscalerElasticity: Scales Pod count based on CPU spikes (e.g., during a sale).Cost Saving: Scales down during low traffic to save EC2/GCE costs.Metrics-Based: Requires a metrics-server to be active in the cluster.10.ds.yml — DaemonSetOne-Per-Node: Ensures a copy of the Pod runs on every single worker node.Infrastructure: Best for logs (Fluentd) or monitoring (Datadog).Auto-Deployment: New nodes automatically receive the DaemonSet Pod.💾 Phase 4: Persistence & ConfigurationStorage Logic11.pv.yml (Persistent Volume): The actual physical disk (EBS/GCP Disk). It is a Global resource.12.pvc.yml (Persistent Volume Claim): The "Request Form" used by a Pod to claim storage. It is Namespace-bound.Configuration Logic13.cm.yml (ConfigMap): Stores non-sensitive settings (URLs, Ports). Decouples code from config.14.sec.yml (Secret): Stores sensitive data (Passwords, Keys). Data is Base64 encoded and mounted in RAM for security.🛡️ Phase 5: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)TypeResourceScopeDescriptionLocal15.ro.yml (Role)NamespaceDefines specific actions (get, list, delete) allowed in one area.Local16.rob.yml (RoleBinding)NamespaceLinks a Role to a User (e.g., Jagadish) to grant local access.Global17.cr.yml (ClusterRole)ClusterPermissions for global resources like Nodes or PVs.Global18.crb.yml (ClusterRoleBinding)ClusterGrants Admin-level power across the entire cluster.
